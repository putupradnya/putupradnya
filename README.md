## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a **data-driven problem solver** with hands-on experience across the **end-to-end data lifecycle** — from data modeling and engineering, analytics, visualization, to applied AI.

Currently, I:
- Lead and manage **Data & AI team**, aligning technical solutions with real business needs  
- Design and optimize **scalable data architectures** (ETL Tools, DWH, & Lakehouse)  
- Build **analytics dashboards** (Power BI, Tableau) that actually get used  
- Experiment with **AI & GenAI**: computer vision, forecasting, and agentic RAG systems  
- Teach **Geophysics Engineering**, blending domain science with modern data approaches  

I enjoy turning **messy data into decision-ready insights** and building systems that are practical, scalable, and explainable.
